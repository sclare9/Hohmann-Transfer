Hohmann Transfer
(IN PROGRESS) Currently this program is being made to calculate the delta v and time it takes to complete a transfer orbit(Hohmann Transfer). A Hohmann transfer is when a spacecraft does two engine burns to change the radius of an orbit in the most efficient way.

To achieve this, the program will take user input or presets, convert units to those necessary, and calculate transfer time and delta V of the transfer.
